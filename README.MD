<h2>Wizard of DATz Redux</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This project is the continuation of the work done by RomShepherd board member Wizard of DATz to create a series of custom DAT files for various websites and systems, and to create merged DATs that remove redundant ROMs from similar DATs.

This is in the severely early stages since it is a complete rewrite of the internal tool that WoD originally used.

Any suggestions are accepted.

<b>Note:</b> Only pull requests for the online checkers will be accepted at this point in time. Any other pages or features that wish to be added must be confirmed by the project lead before they are coded or added.
