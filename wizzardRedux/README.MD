<h2>Wizard of DATz Redux</h2>

This project is the continuation of the work done by RomShepherd board member Wizard of DATz to create a series of custom DAT files for various websites and systems, and to create merged DATs that remove redundant ROMs from similar DATs.

This is in the severely early stages since it is a complete rewrite of the internal tool that WoD originally used.

Any suggestions are accepted.
