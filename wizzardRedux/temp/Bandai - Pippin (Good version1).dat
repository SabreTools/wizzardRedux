NOTE TO SELF:
	WOD's set naming isn't like other set naming, it's generally truncated.
	e.g.
	atMark Town ver.1.0 (1996)(Bandai)(JP)[!][BDB-005B]
	atMark Town ver.1.0 (1996)(Bandai)(JP)[BDB-005A]
	
	both become
	
	atMark Town ver.1.0
	
	because as soon as a ( or [ starts, he trims that part of the title off
	this also means that the description is similarly truncated, and should not be taken from the original file
	the regex should be "/^(.*?) (\(|\[).*$/" and the used part is \1
